Welcome to Kaboom's documentation!
===================================

# What is Kaboom?
Kaboom is a service for tracking comics and cartoons, with an API to retrieve and add data. As of right now, Kaboom is just a backend, and the [website]() does not provide a frontend to interface with the service *yet*. This is why Kaboom needs frontend clients, for users to access the service.

Before starting, please read the [developer guidlines]().
